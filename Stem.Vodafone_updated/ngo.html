      <p>Business owners are using different crowdfunding sites than musicians. Musicians are using different sites from
        causes and charities. Below is a list of crowdfunding sites that have different models and focuses. This list
        can help you find the right place for your crowdfunding goals and needs.</p>
      <p class="heading">1. Kickstarter</p>
      <p><a class="link" title="Kickstarter" href="http://kickstarter.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"
          data-ga-track="ExternalLink:http://kickstarter.com" aria-label="Kickstarter"> Kickstarter</a> is a site where
        creative projects raise donation-based funding. These projects can range from new creative products, like an art
        installation, to a cool watch, to pre-selling a music album. It’s not for businesses, causes, charities, or
        personal financing needs. Kickstarter is one of the earlier platforms, and has experiencedgrowth and
        many break-out large campaigns in the last few years.</p>
      <p class="heading">2.Indiegogo</p>
          <p>While Kickstarter maintains a tighter focus and curates the creative projects approved on its site, <a
              class="link" title="Indiegogo" href="http://indiegogo.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"
              data-ga-track="ExternalLink:http://indiegogo.com" aria-label="Indiegogo">Indiegogo</a> approves
            donation-based
            fundraising campaigns for most anything -- music, hobbyists, personal finance needs, charities and whatever
            else
            you could think of (except investment). They have had international growth because of their flexibility,
            broad
            approach and their early start in the industry.</p>
