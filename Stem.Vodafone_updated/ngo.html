      <h3 class="crowd">Crowdfunding Sites To Choose From</h3>
      <p>Business owners are using different crowdfunding sites than musicians. Musicians are using different sites from
        causes and charities. Below is a list of crowdfunding sites that have different models and focuses. This list
        can help you find the right place for your crowdfunding goals and needs.</p>
      <p class="heading"><a class="link" href="http://kickstarter.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" title="Kickstarter">1. Kickstarter</a></p>
      <p>Kickstarter is a site where creative projects raise donation-based funding. These projects can range from new creative products, like an art
        installation, to a cool watch, to pre-selling a music album. It’s not for businesses, causes, charities, or
        personal financing needs. Kickstarter is one of the earlier platforms, and has experienced growth and
        many break-out large campaigns in the last few years.</p>
      <p class="heading"><a class="link" href="http://indiegogo.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" title="Indiegogo">2. Indiegogo</a></p>
          <p>While Kickstarter maintains a tighter focus and curates the creative projects approved on its site, Indiegogo approves
            donation-based
            fundraising campaigns for most anything -- music, hobbyists, personal finance needs, charities and whatever
            else
            you could think of (except investment). They have had international growth because of their flexibility,
            broad
            approach and their early start in the industry.</p>
          <p class="heading"><a class="link" href="http://crowdfunder.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" title="Crowdfunder">3. Crowdfunder</a></p>
              <p>Crowdfunder is the platform for raising investment (not rewards), and has one of the largest and fastest growing
                network of investors. It was recently featured on <a class="link" href="www.forbes.com/sites/chancebarnett/2014/05/01/2-billion-facebook-acquisition-raises-question-is-equity-crowdfunding-better/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" title="$2 Billion Exit Brings Crowdfunder To the Forefront">Fox News</a> as the new breed of crowdfunding due to the story about a $2 Billion exit
                of a crowdfunded company. After getting rewards-based funding on Kickstarter or Indiegogo, companies are
                often giving the crowd the opportunity to invest at Crowdfunder to raise more formal Seed & Series A
                rounds.</p>
              <p>Crowdfunder offers equity crowdfunding currently only from individuals + angels + VCs, and was a
                leading
                participant in the JOBS Act legislation.</p>

                    Valley
                    momentum, then there are angels and institutions finding investments through AngelList. For a long
                    while
                    AngelList didn’t say that they did crowdfunding, which makes sense as they have catered to the
                    investment
                    establishment of VCs in tech startups, but now they’re getting into the game. The accredited
