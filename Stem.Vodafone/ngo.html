<h3 class="crowd" >Crowdfunding Sites To Choose From</h3> 
<p>Business owners are using different crowdfunding sites than musicians. Musicians are using different sites from causes and charities. Below is a list of crowdfunding sites that have different models and focuses. This list can help you find the right place for your crowdfunding goals and needs.</p> 
<p class="heading" ><strong>1. Kickstarter</strong></p> 
<p><a class="link" title="Kickstarter" href="http://kickstarter.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:http://kickstarter.com" aria-label="Kickstarter"> Kickstarter</a> is a site where creative projects raise donation-based funding. These projects can range from new creative products, like an art installation, to a cool watch, to pre-selling a music album. It’s not for businesses, causes, charities, or personal financing needs. Kickstarter is one of the earlier platforms, and has experienced strong growth and many break-out large campaigns in the last few years.</p> 
<p class="heading" ><strong>2. Indiegogo</strong></p> 
<p>While Kickstarter maintains a tighter focus and curates the creative projects approved on its site, <a class="link" title="Indiegogo" href="http://indiegogo.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:http://indiegogo.com" aria-label="Indiegogo">Indiegogo</a> approves donation-based fundraising campaigns for most anything -- music, hobbyists, personal finance needs, charities and whatever else you could think of (except investment). They have had international growth because of their flexibility, broad approach and their early start in the industry.</p> 
<p><strong></strong></p> 
<strong> </strong> 
<p class="heading" ><strong>3. Crowdfunder</strong></p> 
<p><a class="link" title="Crowdfunder" href="http://crowdfunder.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:http://crowdfunder.com" aria-label="Crowdfunder.com"> Crowdfunder.com</a>&nbsp;is the platform for raising investment (not rewards), and has a one of the largest and fastest growing network of investors. It was recently featured on <a class="link" title="$2 Billion Exit Brings Crowdfunder To the Forefront" href="www.forbes.com/sites/chancebarnett/2014/05/01/2-billion-facebook-acquisition-raises-question-is-equity-crowdfunding-better/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:www.forbes.com/sites/chancebarnett/2014/05/01/2-billion-facebook-acquisition-raises-question-is-equity-crowdfunding-better/" aria-label="Fox News">Fox News</a> as the new breed of crowdfunding due to the story about a $2 Billion exit of a crowdfunded company. After getting rewards-based funding on Kickstarter or Indiegogo, companies are often giving the crowd the opportunity to invest at Crowdfunder to raise more formal Seed &amp; Series A rounds.</p> 
<p>Crowdfunder offers equity crowdfunding currently only from individuals + angels + VCs, and was a leading participant in the JOBS Act legislation.</p> 
<p class="heading" ><strong>4. RocketHub</strong></p>

<p>What’s unique about RocketHub is their FuelPad and LaunchPad programs that help campaign owners and potential promotion and marketing partners connect and collaborate for the success of a campaign.</p> 
<p class="heading" ><strong>5. Crowdrise</strong></p> 
<p><a class="link" title="Crowdrise" href="http://crowdrise.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:http://crowdrise.com" aria-label="Crowdrise"> Crowdrise</a> is a place for donation-based funding for Causes and Charity.

<p class="heading" ><strong>6. Somolend</strong></p>

<p class="heading" ><strong>7. Appbackr</strong></p>

<p class="heading" ><strong>8. AngelList</strong></p>

For a long while AngelList didn’t say that they did crowdfunding, which makes sense as they have catered to the investment establishment of VCs in tech startups, but now they’re getting into the game. The accredited investors and institutions on AngelList have been funding a growing number of top tech startup deals.</p> 
<p class="heading" ><strong>9. Invested.in</strong></p>
